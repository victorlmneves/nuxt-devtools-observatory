# nuxt-devtools-observatory

Nuxt DevTools extension providing five missing observability features:

- **useFetch Dashboard** — central view of all async data calls, cache keys, waterfall timeline
- **provide/inject Graph** — interactive tree showing the full injection topology, value inspection, scope labels, shadow detection, and missing-provider warnings
- **Composable Tracker** — live view of active composables, reactive state, change history, leak detection, inline value editing, and reverse lookup
- **Render Heatmap** — component tree colour-coded by render frequency and duration, with per-render timeline, route filtering, and persistent-component accuracy fixes
- **Transition Tracker** — live timeline of every `<Transition>` lifecycle event with phase, duration, and cancellation state

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add nuxt-devtools-observatory
```

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['nuxt-devtools-observatory'],

    observatory: {
        fetchDashboard: true,
        provideInjectGraph: true,
        composableTracker: true,
        renderHeatmap: true,
        transitionTracker: true,
        heatmapThreshold: 5, // highlight components with 5+ renders
    },

    devtools: { enabled: true },
})
```

Open the Nuxt DevTools panel — five new tabs will appear.

The DevTools client SPA runs on a dedicated Vite development server (port **4949**).

## How it works

All instrumentation is **dev-only**. The module registers Vite transforms that wrap
`useFetch`, `provide/inject`, `useX()` composable calls, and `<Transition>` at the
AST/module level before compilation. In production (`import.meta.dev === false`) the
transforms are skipped entirely — zero runtime overhead.

### useFetch Dashboard

[![useFetch Dashboard](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/fetch-dashboard.png)](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/fetch-dashboard.png)

A Vite plugin wraps `useFetch` / `useAsyncData` calls with a thin shim that records:

- Key, URL, status, origin (SSR/CSR)
- Payload size and duration
- Start offset for waterfall rendering

A Nitro plugin captures server-side fetch timing independently and tunnels it to the
client over the HMR WebSocket.

### provide/inject Graph

[![provide/inject Graph](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/provide-inject-graph.png)](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/provide-inject-graph.png)

A Vite plugin wraps `provide()` and `inject()` calls with annotated versions that
carry file and line metadata. At runtime, a `findProvider()` function walks
`instance.parent` chains to identify which ancestor provided each key.
Any `inject()` that resolves to `undefined` is flagged immediately as a red node.

The panel provides:

- **Interactive SVG graph** — component tree with curved edges; nodes colour-coded by
  role (teal = provides, blue = both, grey = injects, red = missing provider)
- **Value inspection** — each provided key shows an inline preview (e.g. `{ user, isLoggedIn }`)
  with a `view` button to expand the full JSON for complex objects
- **Scope labels** — every provided key carries a `global`, `layout`, or `component`
  badge derived from the providing component's position in the tree
- **Shadow detection** — when a child component re-provides a key already provided by
  an ancestor, the entry is flagged with an amber warning and a `shadowed` filter button
  appears in the toolbar
- **Consumer list** — each provided key shows which components inject it, with chip badges
- **Missing-provider warnings** — unresolved `inject()` calls are shown with a red
  `no provider` badge and the component node turns red in the graph
- **Filter by key** — per-key filter buttons in the toolbar narrow the graph to only
  components involved with a specific key
- **Search** — free-text search across component names and key names
- **Jump to editor** — clicking `open ↗` in the detail panel header opens the selected
  component's source file in the configured editor

### Composable Tracker

[![Composable Tracker](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/composable-tracker.png)](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/composable-tracker.png)

A Vite plugin detects all `useXxx()` calls matching Vue's naming convention and
wraps them with a tracking shim (`__trackComposable`) that:

1. Temporarily replaces `window.setInterval`/`clearInterval` during setup to capture
   any intervals started inside the composable
2. Tracks new Vue effects (watchers) added to the component scope during setup
3. Snapshots returned `ref`, `computed`, and `reactive` values for the live state panel,
   keeping live references so values update in real time without polling
4. Detects shared (global) state by comparing object identity across multiple instances
   of the same composable — keys backed by the same reference are marked as global
5. Records a change history (capped at 50 events) via `watchEffect`, capturing which
   key changed, its new value, and a `performance.now()` timestamp
6. Flags any watcher or interval still active after `onUnmounted` fires as a **leak**

The panel provides:

- **Filtering** by status (all / mounted / unmounted / leaks only) and free-text search
  across composable name, source file, ref key names, and ref values
- **Inline ref chip preview** — up to three reactive values shown on the card without
  expanding, with distinct styling for `ref`, `computed`, and `reactive` types
- **Global state badges** — keys shared across instances are highlighted in amber with
  a `global` badge and an explanatory banner when expanded
- **Change history** — a scrollable log of the last 50 value mutations with key, new
  value, and relative timestamp
- **Lifecycle summary** — shows whether `onMounted`/`onUnmounted` were registered and
  whether watchers and intervals were properly cleaned up
- **Reverse lookup** — clicking any ref key opens a panel listing every other composable
  instance that exposes a key with the same name, with its composable name, file, and route
- **Inline value editing** — writable `ref` values have an `edit` button; clicking opens
  a JSON textarea that applies the new value directly to the live ref in the running app
- **Jump to editor** — an `open ↗` button in the context section opens the composable's
  source file in the configured editor

**Known gaps:**

- Reverse lookup matches by key name only, not by object identity
- Search does not look inside nested `reactive` object properties

### Render Heatmap

[![Render Heatmap](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/render-heatmap.png)](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/render-heatmap.png)

Uses Vue's built-in `renderTriggered` mixin hook and `app.config.performance = true`.
Accurate duration is measured by bracketing each `beforeMount`/`mounted` and
`beforeUpdate`/`updated` cycle with `performance.now()` timestamps.
Component bounding boxes are captured via `$el.getBoundingClientRect()` for the DOM
overlay mode.

Each `RenderEntry` carries a `timeline: RenderEvent[]` (capped at 100 events, newest
last). Every mount and update cycle appends an event recording:

- `kind` — `mount` or `update`
- `t` — `performance.now()` timestamp
- `durationMs` — measured render duration
- `triggerKey` — the reactive dep that caused the update (when `renderTriggered` fired
  before `updated`), formatted as `type: key`
- `route` — the route path at the time of the render

A `route` field on each entry records which route the component was first seen on.
`setRoute()` is called by the plugin on every `router.afterEach` so new entries and
timeline events are always stamped with the correct path.

**Persistent component fix:** layout and persistent components (those that survive
`reset()` and are flagged `isPersistent: true`) previously inflated render counts on
every navigation because their `beforeMount`/`mounted` cycle fired again as Vue
re-attached them to the new page. The registry now detects this case and skips both
the duration recording and the timeline event for the navigation re-attach, while still
counting and recording genuine reactive updates that fire after navigation.

The panel provides:

- **Route filter** — a dropdown in the toolbar listing every route seen across all
  component entries and timeline events; selecting one prunes the component tree to
  only show components that were active on that route
- **Render timeline** — in the detail panel, the last 30 events for the selected
  component showing kind, relative timestamp, duration, trigger key, and route
- **Trigger keys** — surfaced both in the existing triggers list and inline in each
  timeline event
- **Persistent and hydration badges** — `isPersistent` and `isHydrationMount` shown
  as pills in the tree row and the detail panel
- **Jump to editor** — every tree row shows an `↗` button on hover, and the detail
  panel's identity section has an `open ↗` button; both call Vite's built-in
  `/__open-in-editor` endpoint to open the component's source file in the configured
  editor

**Known gaps:**

- The route filter shows components active on a route but cannot hide persistent
  components (they appear on every route by definition)

### Transition Tracker

[![Transition Tracker](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/transition-tracker.png)](https://github.com/victorlmneves/nuxt-devtools-observatory/blob/main/docs/screenshots/transition-tracker.png)

A Vite plugin intercepts `import ... from 'vue'` in user code and serves a virtual
proxy module that overrides the `Transition` export with an instrumented wrapper.
This is necessary because the Vue 3 template compiler generates direct named imports
(`import { Transition as _Transition } from "vue"`) that bypass `app.component()`
entirely.

The wrapper records every lifecycle phase without interfering with Vue's internal
CSS/JS timing detection:

| Hook               | Phase recorded    |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `onBeforeEnter`    | `entering`        |
| `onAfterEnter`     | `entered`         |
| `onEnterCancelled` | `enter-cancelled` |
| `onBeforeLeave`    | `leaving`         |
| `onAfterLeave`     | `left`            |
| `onLeaveCancelled` | `leave-cancelled` |

> `onEnter` / `onLeave` are intentionally **not** wrapped — Vue inspects their
> `.length` property to choose CSS-mode vs JS-mode timing, and wrapping changes
> that length.

The Transitions tab shows a live timeline with name, direction, phase, duration,
parent component, and cancellation state for every transition fired on the page.
Data is bridged from the Nuxt app (port 3000) to the Observatory SPA (port 4949)
via `postMessage` since the two origins are cross-origin inside the DevTools iframe.

## Opting out

Add a `/* @devtools-ignore */` comment before any call to exclude it from instrumentation:

```ts
/* @devtools-ignore */
const { data } = useFetch('/api/sensitive')

/* @devtools-ignore */
const result = useMyComposable()
```

## Roadmap

### Composable Tracker

- [ ] Reverse lookup by object identity rather than key name only
- [ ] Deep search inside nested `reactive` object properties

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the playground
